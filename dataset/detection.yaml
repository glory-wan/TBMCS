# This is a sample directory structure for a multi-task learning dataset.
# You can use one or more tasks to train your data (e.g., classification, detection, segmentation),
# as *** is a highly flexible and decoupled multi-task learning model.
#
# Additionally, our data labeling format follows the ultralytics (commonly known as YOLO) format.
# Of course, you can define your own data loading class in
# mtl/dataset/custom_dataset_template.py to fit your labels and data.
